# third-order-Butterworth-filter

An LTspice project which contains third-order Butterworth filters built both using an inductor and a current conveyor. The scripts plot the frequency responses of both ideal designs of third-order Butterworth filters on the same graph when simulated.

This project was assigned for the Computer Tools for Electrical Engineers (EE 241) course in the Fall 2020-21 semester.
